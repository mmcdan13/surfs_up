## Project Overview

To open the surfboard and icecream shop "Surf n Shake" in Oahu, Hawaii, our stakeholder needs investor backing. Our prospective investor W. Avy is interested in knowing the weather data since he does not want the business to get rained out. He specifically wants to know the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
